    Description:
      Abstract:
        The National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) program was initiated by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy; DOE) in 1973 with a primary goal of identifying uranium resources in the United States.  The Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (HSSR) program was one of nine components of NURE.  Planned systematic sampling of stream sediments, soils, groundwater, and surface water over the entire United States began in 1975 under the responsibility of four DOE national laboratories: Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (LLL), Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP), and Savannah River Laboratory (SRL). Each DOE laboratory developed its own sample collection, analytical, and data management methodologies and hired contractors to collect the samples.

        The NURE HSSR sampling program ended prematurely in 1980.  The samples were analyzed and the resultant geochemical data were released on 9-track tapes and in a series of publications.  By 1984, the NURE program was finished as Congressional funding disappeared. Out of a total of 625 2-degree quadrangles that cover the entire lower 48 States and Alaska, only 307 quadrangles were completely sampled and another 86 quadrangles were partially sampled. The HSSR data consisted of 894 separate data files stored on magnetic tape in 47 different file formats.

        The University of Oklahoma's Information Systems Programs of the Energy Resources Institute (ISP) was contracted by the Department of Energy to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of the NURE HSSR data. ISP created a single standard-format master file to replace 894 original files. ISP converted only 817 of the 894 original files before their funding ended.  Unfortunately, this conversion process was never completed and introduced several systematic errors into the database.

        In 1985, the NURE HSSR sample archive, original field maps, field notes, and data tapes became the responsibility of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  A copy of the ISP-formatted NURE HSSR database was released as two CD-ROM publications (Hoffman and Buttleman, 1994; 1996).

        A new effort to recompile the NURE HSSR was begun by the USGS in 1995.  All of the original 894 files have been examined, reformatted, and added to this USGS enhanced version of the NURE HSSR data.  The data are contained in 2 major database files: one for water samples and one for sediment samples (which also includes soil and some rock samples.)  An earlier version of this USGS enhanced version of the NURE HSSR data was released as an online Open-File Report at https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/

      Purpose: The NURE HSSR samples were collected specifically to explore the United States for undiscovered uranium resources.  Initially, the samples were only analysed for uranium contents but a due to a change in policy, most samples were eventually analyzed for as many as 45 different constituents.  Although the data were originally intended for mineral exploration purposes, these data have also found application in the fields of earth science, ecology, environmental geochemistry, health, and medical geology.  Since all of the samples were collected and analyzed within a short period of time (1975-1980) they represent a snapshot or a baseline of geochemical conditions during that period.  Some of the sampled sites may no longer be accessible for resampling due to continued urban and industrial development.

    Data_Set_Credit: The reformatting effort for the USGS enhanced version of the NURE HSSR database was done by Steven M. Smith, Andrew W. Holt, and Bryan G. Moravec.  This effort was aided greatly by the earlier work of James D. Hoffman in obtaining, reading, converting, and preserving the original NURE files found on deteriorating 9-track magnetic tapes.
  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        The site and sample description parameters were recorded on preprinted field forms by the individual collectors working for sub-contractors.  Many of these parameters required critical judgement by the collector or information obtained from the landowner or resident.  The accuracy of site and sample description parameters varies with the Dept. of Energy Laboratory responsible for the regional sampling program, the study, the subcontractor, and the individual sample collector.

        The samples in this dataset were chemically analyzed by several laboratories using a variety of techniques that changed over time.  The accuracy of the geochemical data varies with the laboratory, the study, the analytical methodology, the element, and with the concentration of the element being analyzed.  Values that were less than the lower detection limits of an analytical method were reported as a negative number: A value of -2 in the AG_PPM field is equivalent to <2 ppm Ag.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      The responsibility for the NURE HSSR program was given to four U.S. Dept. of Energy Laboratories.  Each lab was assigned a region of the United States and given the authority to develop their own collection, analytical, and data management methodologies.  This decision resulted in the creation of several different sample collection manuals, preprinted sample collection note forms, analytical methods, and data report formats.  Thus there is a large amount of inconsistency in reported data between laboratories; especially in the site and sample description fields.  Program changes over time also introduced additional inconsistencies, even within data reports from a single laboratory.

      One of the primary goals of this reformatting effort has been the elimination of as many inconsistencies as possible.  These problems with consistency fall into at least 7 categories.  The following describes each category of consistency problem and the formatting process used to resolve the issue.  Many database fields had some combination of these consistency problems.

      1) A common parameter was recorded using different format styles. As an example, all four labs reported the sample collection date in differing formats (March 5, 1976 was reported as 03/05/76, 3/ 5/76, 3/05/76, 030576, 760305, or 76 3 5). All of these have been changed to a consistent format for every record (1976/03/05).

      2) A common parameter was recorded using different units of measure.  For example, in sediment data the concentration of magnesium (Mg) was originally reported in percent or parts-per-million (ppm) or parts-per-billion (ppb).  In these cases, all values were converted to a common unit: All Mg values in the sediment database are now reported in percent.  This same issue was also found and resolved for measurement parameters that were originally recorded either in feet or meters.

      3) A common descriptive parameter was recorded on sample collection note forms and entered into the database using different coding schemes with differing lists of choices.  An example of this problem is illustrated by the SEDTYPE field, which describes the dominant type of sediment found at the sample site.  The choice of 'sand' was recorded as a code '4' by two sample collection forms, a code '3' by one, and a code 'S' by another.  'Muck' was recorded as a code '5', '6', or '7' depending upon the responsible lab, but was not even an available choice for sample collectors for a fourth lab.  A code for 'mud' was available on only one sample collection form.  This issue was resolved by replacing all codes with the corresponding defined value of 'SAND', 'MUCK', 'MUD', and so on.  However, since all values were not available to all of the sample collectors, fields with this problem will not be entirely consistent.

      4) A descriptive parameter was not recorded by all of the responsible laboratories.  This is a very common problem.  There are very few descriptive parameter fields that were actually used and recorded for all samples.  Whereas the water temperature at the site was recorded on all sample collection field forms, only forms from two labs recorded air temperature, and only one lab recorded the percentage of organic material in the sample.  Thus these fields are incompletely populated and consistent only for the laboratories that reported data.

      5) A common parameter was given slightly different definitions by individual laboratories.  For example, all of the labs recorded information about possible contamination sources at the sample site but each lab defined what constituted a contaminant source in a slightly different way.  For fields with this problem, the original value was preserved in the field and the individual definitions were recorded in the documentation for that field.

      6) A descriptive parameter called for the subjective judgement of the sample collector.  Several sample description note forms included parameters that are inherently subjective.  Parameters such as sample color, vegetation density, and contaminant sources are likely to have a lot of variation depending upon the skill and consistency of each individual sampler.  Subjective color identifications between observation are often inconsistent for a single person and even more so for multiple people.  These variations can be observed in the database between samplers within the same area.  A similar inconsistency is found in the quality and quantity of sample site comments recorded on sample collection forms.  Inconsistencies of this sort could not and were not addressed during the reformatting effort.  The values given in the database are the original values recorded by the person or persons responsible for collecting the sample.

      7) Two or more descriptive parameters for a single sample appear to contain contradictory information.  For example, the sample may be described as a 'DRY' stream sediment collected from stream with a water depth of 1 ft.  This type of inconsistency is common. It may be due to sampler error, data entry error, or situations that could not be adequately described with the parameter choices available.  Most of these inconsistencies were left in the database.  In a few cases, values for parameters that were clearly impossible were removed (such as a well depth value for a stream sediment).  Whenever an offending value was removed from a record, that event and the original value was recorded in the REFORMAT comment field.

      More information about possible inconsistencies within any database field is available in the Manual for Interpreting NURE HSSR Data at <https://mrdata.usgs.gov/nure/sediment/NURE_Manual.html>

    Completeness_Report:
      This dataset provides chemical data for Ag, Al, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl-, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Cy, Eu, F, Fe, Ga, He, Hf, Hg, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Pt, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Si, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, Zr, PO4 (phosphate), NO3 (nitrite), SO4 (sulfate), methane, ethane, propane, and butane in samples of stream sediment, spring sediment, lake or pond sediment, soil, rock, well water, stream water, and spring water.  In addition, the dataset provides location and descriptive information for each sample.

      No sample contains data in all of the descriptive fields or in all of the chemical data fields.  Additionally, no descriptive field or chemical data field is completely populated within the NURE HSSR dataset.  The amount of data in descriptive fields varies with the DOE Laboratory that was responsible for sample collection.  The amount of data in elemental fields varies with the responsible DOE Laboratory and with the analytical methods used.

      Descriptions of the sample collection protocols, preprinted sample field note forms, and analytical methods are found in the following publications.

        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          The latitude-longitude coordinates for sample locations were determined by digitizing sites from maps of various scales and sources.  For most the United States the maps were USGS 1:24,000-scale, 1:62,500-scale, or 1:63,360-scale topographic quadrangles.  In the eastern quarter of the U.S. that was sampled by Savannah River Laboratory subcontractors, county highway maps of various scales and quality were the main source of maps used for locating sites.  The accuracy is dependent upon the scale and quality of the map from which the location was determined as well as the care taken by the individual responsible for digitizing.  Latitude-longitude coordinates were reported as decimal degrees.  All labs except for the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP) reported coordinates with 4 decimal places implying an accuracy to within 11 meters (36 feet).  ORGDP reported coordinates only to 3 decimal places with an implied accuracy of 110 meters (360 feet).

          The USGS topographic maps, from which latitude and longitude coordinates were determined, use the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27) based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.  Most county highway maps do not identify the projection, datum, or ellipsoid used.  It is assumed that coordinates on these maps are also derived from NAD27 and the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.

          Coordinates for a small percentage of samples are either missing or obviously incorrect.  In both cases, the latitude and/or longitude fields were populated with a value of 0 (zero) and any known information about the location, including the incorrect values, were recorded in the COORDPRB comment field during the reformatting process.  Some, but not all, of the missing or incorrect coordinates have been recovered from original field maps.  More of these problem locations may be fixed at a later date.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: The NURE HSSR data were originally generated by four Department of Energy Laboratories (Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (LLL), Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP), and Savannah River Laboratory (SRL)) and at least one unspecified subcontractor laboratory.  These data were determined from samples collected between 1975 and 1980.  The analytical determinations were completed between 1975 and 1982.  The data were originally released in published GJBX-series reports and as digital data files on 9-track magnetic tape by study area, quadrangle and/or state. When finished, the NURE HSSR database consisted of at least 847 different files in 49 different digital formats.
        Process_Time: 1975 to 1982
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: In 1982, the Information Systems Program (ISP) of the Energy Resources Institute at the University of Oklahoma was contracted to "enhance the accessibility and usefulness" of the NURE HSSR data.  ISP created a new standard format database file and converted 817 of the original NURE HSSR files to this format.
        Process_Time: 1982 to 1985
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          In 1985, the responsibility for the NURE HSSR data was transferred from the Department of Energy to the U.S. Geological Survey.  The data were downloaded from magnetic tapes and then re-released as a series of CD-ROM publications.  All of these CD-ROM publications utilized the NURE HSSR database that had been compiled by the Information Systems Program (ISP) of the Energy Resources Institute at the University of Oklahoma.  The final CD-ROM (Hoffman and Buttleman, 1996) also included a subdirectory with all of the original NURE HSSR files archived in a compressed format.

        Process_Time: 1985 to 1996
      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Use of the ISP-compiled version of the NURE HSSR database revealed several inconsistencies, some introduced systematic errors, duplicated records, and missing data.  Beginning in 1994, efforts to use large amounts of NURE HSSR data from the state of Montana led to a decision to recompile the NURE HSSR data from the original files.  The success of this task led to a larger project with the goal of reformatting the entire NURE HSSR database.

          A new comprehensive database structure was created after examining the ISP database structure, each of the laboratory sampling manuals, the field sampling note forms, and the GJBX-3(84) publication (Zinkl, R.J., and Brock, D.S., 1984, User's guide to NURE HSSR tape formats:  Report of Bendix Field Engineering Corporation prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy, Grand Junction, Colo., GJBX-3(84), 168 p.) It was also determined that the data were easier to compile and use if separated into a sediment dataset and a water dataset.

          Reformatting began with data from 2-degree quadrangles in Montana and then proceeded, quadrangle-by-quadrangle, across the conterminous U.S. and Alaska.  The original NURE HSSR files were obtained from a subdirectory on the Hoffman and Buttleman (1996) CD-ROM.  For each quadrangle, all of the original files were first compared with the corresponding GJBX-series data release and data interpretation publications.  Data missing in the digital files were added from the hard copy publications.  The data were then reformatted and compiled.  Often multiple files from a quadrangle contained records for the same sample.  These records were compared and, when possible, combined into single records per sample.  Additional data, not included in the original data formats, were also added to the database records based on the information found in the publications; including quadrangle names and analytical methods.  Occasionally, it was necessary to check original field notes and maps to resolve problems but this was not done systematically.

          Finally, a summary was written for each quadrangle that included descriptions of each NURE study in the quadrangle; information about the samples collected and analytical methods used; a brief description of how the data were processed during the reformatting phase; notes about known inconsistencies or potential problems; indications of other known but unobtained sources of NURE-related geochemical data; and a quadrangle bibliography.  These NURE HSSR quadrangle summaries are published online at <https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/index.html>.
